This website is all about my personal policial statements (for now).
Some of them are in English, others are in German.

Some personal information:
I'm Jim Martens, 22 years old and I am studying Computer Science at
the University of Hamburg.

I am also engaged in the political sphere of the university. For example
I am in the student parliament for my second term now. In addition I was
elected into the presidium of the parliament for this term.
