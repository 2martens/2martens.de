This website is all about my personal policial statements (for now).
Some of them are in English, others are in German.

Some personal information:
I'm Jim Martens, 23 years old and I am studying Computer Science at
the University of Hamburg.

I am also engaged in the political sphere of the university. For example
I am in the student parliament for my third and last term now. In addition I was
elected into the presidium of the parliament in the last term.

Furthermore I am active in the Green party and the Green Youth.
