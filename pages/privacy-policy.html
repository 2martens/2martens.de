<h2>Data Protection</h2>
<p>The operators of this website take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data
    confidentially and according to the legal data protection regulations and this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. Personal data, such as names, addresses
    or email addresses, are always provided on a voluntary basis when possible. Those data will not be passed on to third
    parties without your explicit permission.</p> <p>However, we would like to point out that data transmissions via
    internet (e.g email communication) cannot be entirely secure and may have security vulnerabilities. A complete protection
    of personal details against unauthorised access by third parties is not possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Server-log-files</h2>
<p>The provider of these websites automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files which your
    browser automatically transmits to us, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>browser type/version</li>
    <li>used operating system</li>
    <li>referrer URL</li>
    <li>host name of the accessing computer</li>
    <li>time of query</li>
</ul>
<p>Those data cannot be associated with individual persons. We do not merge this data with other sources. We reserve the
    right to retrospectively check the data if there is any indication of illegal use.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>YouTube</h2>
<p>Our website uses plugins from the Google-operated website YouTube. The provider of the website is YouTube, LLC, 901
    Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. If you visit one of our websites with an embedded YouTube-plugin, a connection
    to YouTube servers will be established. Information about which of our websites you have visited will then be
    transmitted to the YouTube server.</p>
<p>If you are logged on to your YouTube account, you allow YouTube to associate your browsing behaviour with your personal
    profile. You may prevent this by logging out of YouTube.</p> <p>You will find further information concerning the
    treatment of user data in the YouTube Privacy Policy under:
    <a href="https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy">https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>SSL Encryption</h2>
<p>For security reasons, and to protect the transmission of confidential data, such as enquiries you send to us as the
    provider, this website uses an SSL encryption. You can recognise an encrypted connection by the change in the address
    line of the browser from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock-symbol in your browser address line.</p>
<p>When the SSL encryption is activated, the data you have transmitted to us cannot be accessed by third parties.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Objection to commercial mails</h2>
<p>Providers are obligated to publish contact information in the Legal Notice/Impressum. The use of such contact
    information by third parties for the purpose of distributing unsolicited advertisements or other commercial information
    is prohibited. The operators of this website reserve the right to take legal measures against senders of unsolicited
    commercial information, e.g. spam emails etc.</p>
