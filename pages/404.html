<h2>Solutions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Perhaps you have misspelled? Check the spelling and try again.</li>
    <li>
        The link is recent and you still end up here? With the relaunch of 2martens.de some links changed,
        so try the <a href="{% link index.html %}">home page</a> and the instructions there to find the post or page
        you are searching.
    </li>
    <li>Perhaps the post or page related to your link doesn't exist anymore. Then you are out of luck.</li>
