<h1>G20</h1>

<p>
    On this page you can find all my blog posts related to the G20 summit 2017 in Hamburg. At this point this includes
    only the reports from the G20 special committee that was installed after the fact by the Hamburg parliament to
    investigate everything related to G20 and the violence that erupted in that time frame.
