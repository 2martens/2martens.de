<h1>Speeches</h1>

<p>
    On this page you can find all my speeches. Each post is structured in the same way. If available the embedded
    video of the speech comes first, followed by the exact transcript of the speech. It is therefore entirely optional
    to watch the video (if available) unless you are explicitly interested in the visual part. Below you can find
    the speeches.
